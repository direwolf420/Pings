Enemies, resources, and other interesting objects can be [b]marked[/b] using a bindable hotkey, creating a "point of interest" (referred to as "ping").
The locations of marked creatures and objects are visible in the world and on the map, making it a useful tool for alerting teammates to the location of enemies or loot.

Pinging NPCs has the benefit of stopping them from despawning if no players are in range.

The perfect mod for multiplayer!

[b]Quick Guide:[/b]
* Press and release the hotkey to create a ping
* Hold the hotkey for a second to also notify everyone through the in-game chat
* Ping the same object again to remove the ping

[b]Things you can ping:[/b]
* Yourself (Rendezvous location)
* Tiles (Blocks, ore veins, furniture, etc.)
* NPCs (Enemies, critters, etc.)
* Dropped items

Duration, limit and cooldown of pings are configurable in the server config, ping visuals in the client config.
